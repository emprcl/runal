# Runal

![GitHub release (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/emprcl/runal) ![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/emprcl/runal/build.yml)

:notebook: **[User Manual](https://empr.cl/runal/)**

Runal is a simple creative coding environment for the terminal.
It works similarly as [p5js](https://p5js.org/) and can either be programmed with JavaScript, or used as a Go package.

**_Runal is a work-in-progress. It has only been tested on Linux and the API should not be considered as stable until it reaches 1.0._**

_Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/emprcl/runal/issues/new)._

## Installation

### Download executables

[Download the last release](https://github.com/emprcl/runal/releases) for your platform.

Then:
```sh
# Extract files
mkdir -p runal && tar -zxvf runal_VERSION_PLATFORM.tar.gz -C runal
cd runal

# Run runal
./runal -f sketch.js
```

### Go install

If your a developer using Go, you can use the `go install` command:
```
go install github.com/emprcl/runal@latest
```

## Usage

### JavaScript runtime

You can use JavaScript for scripting your sketch. Your js file should contain a `setup` and a `draw` method. Both methods take a single argument (here `c`) representing a canvas object that holds all the available primitives:
```js
// sketch.js

function setup(c) {}

function draw(c) {}
```

You can add an extra method `onKey` to catch keyboard events:
```js
function onKey(c, key) {}
````

And you can then execute the file with:
```sh
./runal -f sketch.js
```

The js file will be automatically reloaded when modified, no need to restart the command.


### Go package

Because Runal is written in Go, you can also use it as a Go package.

```go
// sketch.go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"os"
	"os/signal"

	"github.com/emprcl/runal"
)

func main() {
	runal.Run(context.Background(), setup, draw, nil)
}

func setup(c *runal.Canvas) {}

func draw(c *runal.Canvas) {}
```

Then, simply build it:
```
go run sketch.go
```
